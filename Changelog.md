## [2.0.0] - 2020-MM-DD

### Added

- New `generate-env` command for creating multiple environments (staging/test/dev/etc. in addition to production).
- Introduced the `\App\CommandQuestion\QuestionInterface`. Question classes reduce code duplication
and make the command classes smaller. They automatically add options/argument to the command that uses them.
- Introduced the `\App\CommandQuestion\Pool` to reduce Command class constructors.
- Introduced a few new services to extract common or unnatural code from the commands.

### Changed

- Commands `setup:magento` and `dockerize` now create only one environment (production) and ask user to add more
environment in the interactive mode.

### Removed

- Replaced `--prod` and `--dev` options with `--domains` option from the `\App\CommandQuestion\Question\Domains` class
